Jschx's ufetch Terminal Info Utility Modified for Other Systems
  
If you know what the ufetch script is, then you don't need any instructions. This repo is for versions of ufetch that have been modified to work on platforms which are not covered by [jschx's repository](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch).
  
So far there is [one for **OpenWrt**](https://github.com/bongochong/ufetch-mods/blob/main/ufetch-owrt.sh), and [one for **Android** (*Termux*)](https://github.com/bongochong/ufetch-mods/blob/main/ufetch-termux.sh). More ufetch forks may appear, and additions are encouraged. Simply make a pull request, and - provided it works - I will merge your commits forthwith, including whatever credits you wish to be specified.
  
I modified the OpenWrt version myself, and the Android version was [initially created here](https://gitlab.com/jschx/ufetch/-/merge_requests/65) (by the gitlab user [bulatovv] (https://gitlab.com/bulatovv/ufetch)), though I made some minor improvements to it. Of-course all of this work is based on the original ufetch by jschx, who has stipulated that the following notice be included in modifications of his work:
